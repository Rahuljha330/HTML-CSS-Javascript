# HTML-CSS-Javascript
(Note:  Guys if you download or clone repo please jus open @startup(only open this html).html for the whole project to work at once)
Or if you want can jus open any file to review and copy the code
This is a quick project of me kinda building a website real quick and integrating HTML 5 , CSS 3 and Javascript together.
