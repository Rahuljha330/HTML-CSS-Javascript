<h1 align="Center"><Strong><b><u> Building a pc</u></b></Strong></h1>
<p1><b><em>If you would like to build a desktop pc ,you will have to assemble all the 
relevant components in the proper and the correct way. If you are a beginner,the <br>
whole process will look complicated. If you approach a computer shop for pc 
building, they will probably dump a whole bunch of components on to you <br>
which your pc might not require. Hence, it is vital for you to understand the core
function of each componenent before venturing to assemble a pc. In this chapter, <br>
We would provide a list of all the important component recquire for building a pc.</em></b></p1> <br><br>

<p2> Their is the list of the componenents required during PC built: </p2>

<h2><ul><li><u> CPU and CPU Cooler</u></li></ul> </h2>
<p3> As the norm has it,sporting high gigahertz is like flexing your muscles, showing off power.It is not uncommon to compare,two <Br>
 CPUs based on their clock speed and core counts. We believe 
our reader like yourself might already known what a cpu is.<br> So, we are not going to bore you 
with the defination once again.As we talk here we CPU actually means processors.</p3> <br><br>
<p4> Here is the name of top companies which sell processor:

<ul>
  <li> Intel  (Computer)  </li>
  <li> AMD  (Computer)</li>
  <li> Qualcomn (Android) </li>
  <li> Mediatek (Android)  </li>
  <li> Exynos (Samsung mobiles) </li>
  <li> Apple A series (iPhones) </li>
</ul>

<Br>

<h3><ul><li><u> Motherboard </u></li></ul></h3>
<p5> <font color="Red">If the CPU is the brains of the system, the motherboard must be the backbone to which everything <br>
else is connected. Motherboard, sometimes also referred to as Mainboard and sometimes simply. the board <br>
is the largest component inside the CPU cabinet to which your processor, RAM modules, graphics card etc,are <br>
connected. It has the system buses, chipsets and power linesfor components attached to it.</font> </p5> <br><br>

<p6> There are<b> FIVE</b> types in which motherboard is classified:</p6>

  <ol>
  <li>Nano ATX </li>
  <li>Pico ATX </li>
  <li>Mini ATX </li>
  <li>Micro ATX </li> 
  <li>Standard ATX </li>
  </ol> <br>
  
  <h4><ul> <li><u>RAM (Memory)</u></li></ul> </h4>
  <p7> RAM or Random acess memory is named as such because once upon a time,we had 'Tapes' as storage medium.<br>
To acess data on those tapes,one had to wind them continously to reach the point where data resided- much like an <br>
 audio casette.Electronic,volatile memory was easier to acess-you could just ask for data at any address and it <br>
 would deliver.therefore, they were named as such. </p7><br><br>

<p8> RAM is also called the Primary Memory and most of the times just "memory'. The name of "primary memory" is <br>
 attributed to the fact that RAM is the first place the CPU looks into for data before it tries to load anything <br>
 from the stroge media, which are not-so-surprisingly also known as secondary memory.</p8> <br><br>
 
 <p9> There are <b> Four </b> type of in which the the <b> RAM </b> are classified :
 <ol>
 <li>DDR 1</li>
 <li>DDR 2</li>
 <li>DDR 3</li>
 <li>DDR 4</li>
 
 <h5> <ul><li><u>Storage</u></li></ul> </h5>
 <p10> While the RAM is called memory, permanent memory is normally referred to as storage.Hard Disk drives (HDDs)have <bR>
 been the norm in the industry for a long time.Before they came into fashion, storage tapes were used. Hard disks used read/ <bR>
 write heads which could move to acess any track on a spinning disk. This allowed for faster acess to a block of the storage<bR>
 without having the user wait for the disc to wind or rewind. While tapes are still in use today as data centre backup storage,<bR>
their use is gradually coming to an end.SSDs or Solid State Disks are relatively newer and a lot faster than traditional spinning <bR>
hard disks.</p10>  <bR><br>

<p11><ul><li><u> Hybrid Disks</u> </li></ul> </p11> 
<p12><font color="Green">Part of a hybrid disk is a SSD while the rest is a normal HDD. Mapping is done nternally by controller chip. The first few <bR>
GBs are mapped to the SDD while the later parts are mapped to the HDD. When you install the OS on the first partition of the disk,<bR>
it gets installed in the SDD,thus allowing for a super-fast OS startup. They are a win -win when it comes to performance /price ratio.</font></p12><bR><bR>

<p13><ul><li><u><b>Graphics Card</b></u></li></ul>
<p14><font color="Purple">Modern procesors house a decent-enough graphics system within their package. Normally these built-in graphics systems can deliver <br>
 a great audio-visual experience by packing in hardware logics to encode/decode media formats and bitmappin technologies to display pictures on the screen.<br>
 But they are not well-equipped to deal with heavyweight 3D rendering. That's where a graphic card comes in.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<nobr>

<h7><ul><li><b><u>Cabinet</u> </b></li></ul></h7>
<p> A case or cabinet or chaissis is not always the components that comes to mind first when one sets out to build a new PC. The cabinet is as important as any<br>
 other component going inside it. It's the container of all the components that make up the computational part of the PC - the motherboard,CPU,RAM,graphics card<br>
 optical drives,HDDs and SSDs. Here's a daily reminder that a CPU and PC cabinet aren't the same,so stop calling them a CPU.The whole cabinet and it's all component<br>are together known as 'system'.</p><br><br>

 <h7><ul><li><b><u>Power Supply</u> </b></li></ul></h7>
 <p>Getting the latest CPU and Graphics Card is all well and good but remember,they need power to run.Indermining the importance of a good power supply unit( alternatively <br>
 known as SMPS) is one way to fry up your system. If youy are housing a couple of hard disks,a powerful CPU and two of the latest and greatest GPUs,you can't do without a decent<br>
 power supply unit.</p><br>
 
 <h8><ul><li><b><u>Monitor/Display</u> </b></li></ul></h8>
 <p>A great and powerful CPU is all well and fine if there is a monitor to watch what it can do.Monitors or Displays are what convert performance to pleasure. A powerful PC with <br>
 a bad display is no fun.In this chapter, we will tell you how to select a good one. Display size is the biggest factor when choosing a monitor.While there are smaller displays,<br>
 sized below 19-inch,we would not recommend you that.You must understand that a smaller display is not going to make your video waching and browsing/reading experience good.If <br>
 you want to play games,less than 19-inch is truly small by today's standards.</p>
